To run the program, i believe (im possibly entirely wrong) all you have to do is download the .jar executable file "Trigonometer.jar",
and if you have java installed it should just run.

A few friends have tried running it and it failed, even though they had java installed,
I found however that if they also installed the java dev kit (JDK, just google it) it magically worked.

Either way, all code is in ".src" so someone smarter than me can figure out how to get java to work properly on their machine.
